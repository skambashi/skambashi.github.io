## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer | Revenue and Experimentation, Code  
**Warp.dev** — *Remote (Seattle, WA)*  
*August 2023 – Present*

#### Codebase Indexing
- Spearheaded datastore architecture for scaling up our codebase indexing system. Implemented integrations with Bigtable for document embedding and merkle tree caching, and turbopuffer for high-performance vector search for documents in coding interactions with our LLM agent.
- Designed and implemented schema for distributed caches and vector indices, with a focus on preventing race conditions and ensuring consistency during high-concurrency access patterns. Implemented cache eviction strategies to clean up stale data while maintaining data integrity and performance under load.
- Built merkle tree diffing logic to reconcile local snapshots against real-time filesystem state, ensuring accurate sync between client and server on app initialization.

#### Enterprise Database Isolation
- Implemented and rolled out new single-tenant database layer for enterprise customers with stronger security guarantees and database isolation.

#### Billing Framework
- Designed and implemented comprehensive end-to-end billing framework to support multiple subscription plans and enterprise tiers, unblocking revenue and enabling the company to grow to over $2m ARR in one year.
- Integrated Stripe for automated tier provisioning and built a framework to enforce feature limits across all clients and servers. Enabled cross-functional teams to adjust tier limits, define custom enterprise tiers, and run feature-driven conversion experiments.

#### GraphQL V2
- Implemented new standardized request/response format and streamlined process for defining new GraphQL APIs, reducing generated code by 10%, and improving compile times and developer productivity on our Rust client.

### Software Engineer | Application Infrastructure, Gateway Infrastructure  
**Databricks** — *San Francisco, CA / Seattle, WA*  
*August 2018 – June 2023*

#### Rate Limiting Service
- Led development of a custom, global rate-limiting service built on gRPC and Redis, handling over 100k QPS of incoming traffic to the control plane in the largest regions.
- Replaced an open-source service with a custom implementation to enable tighter integration with internal tooling, support for dynamic rate limits, and rapid abuse mitigation, reducing response time from minutes to seconds.

#### Service-to-Service Communication
- Led the transition of Databricks’ RPC service framework from using HTTP headers with shared secrets to per-service provisioned secrets for generating signed JWTs, standardizing context propagation across control plane services, and ensuring secure request authentication and auditing.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams across multiple technology stacks (Python, Scala, Java) to ensure smooth integration and consistent context propagation between services.

#### Monolith to Microservices
- Contributed to re-architecting Databricks’ largest monolithic application into scalable, stateless microservices.
- Extracted authentication and routing into independent services using gRPC and Envoy, reducing p99 latency by 50% and enabling independent scaling of proxy and auth services for high-traffic API requests.
