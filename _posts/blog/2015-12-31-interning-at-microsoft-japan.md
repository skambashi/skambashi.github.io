I can't put into words the awesome time I had while working at Microsoft Japan, so I hope the following pictures do it justice:

The Sway document you see above is hosted on the site that I helped build during my time at Microsoft called [Docs.com](https://docs.com/){:target="_blank"} as part of the Office team.

I would like to thank all my friends and mentors that I had the privilege of meeting and working with during my time in Japan.

_I would also like to say thank you to my grandmother. I am grateful that I was able to see her and the rest of the family._
