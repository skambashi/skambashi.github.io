This is an ultimate tic tac toe game app. It requires a player to win a tic tac toe game within each square of a bigger tic tac toe board. By doing so, the player can mark that block as theirs. General tic tac toe rules apply in both the inner and outer contexts of the game.

This app was my first real attempt at working with the Android platform. I focused mostly on the front-end, creating and editing layouts and interfaces.

It was a project that started during the University of Waterlooâ€™s Software Engineering Hackday, also known as SE Hackday. This app was developed in a team with Gabriel Wong and Andy Zhang.
