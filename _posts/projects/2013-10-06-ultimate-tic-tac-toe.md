It's tic tac toe inside tic tac toe! Talk about meta. General game rules apply in both the inner and outer layers of the game.

It was a fun project that we started during one of our Software Engineering hackathons known as _SE Hackday_. This game was developed in a team with Gabriel Wong and Andy Zhang.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gabrielwong/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe/tree/graphics){:target="_blank"}.
