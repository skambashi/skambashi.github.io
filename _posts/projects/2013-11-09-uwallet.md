Displays information about a student’s WatCard (University of Waterloo’s student ID card). Things such as balance, transaction history and statistics are accessible through the phone.

When creating this app, I focused on interactivity between fragments, as well as securely storing user information.

This project began during UWaterloo’s Engineering Hackathon where our team, composed of Scott So, Gabriel Wong, Jessica Wu and Andy Zhang placed second!
