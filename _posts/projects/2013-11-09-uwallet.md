Okay, so not really a digital wallet, but the name was awesome and it stuck.
It displays information about a student’s WatCard (UWaterloo’s student ID card). Things such as balance and transaction history are accessible through the app.

This project began during UWaterloo’s _EngHack_ where our team composed of Scott So, Gabriel Wong, Jessica Wu, and Andy Zhang placed second!

It's currently available for download in the [Google Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.uwallet.main&hl=en){:target="_blank"}!

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andyzg/UWallet){:target="_blank"}.
