Automatically turn tweets into gifs from your favourite movies with your own personal flavour!

Using IBM Watson's [Relationship Extraction api](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/relationship-extraction.html){:target="_blank"}, we analyzed thousands of subtitles from different movies and abstracted it to its general structure. Users are then able to replace key elements of the sentence such as nouns and verbs with their own. We then renders a gif of that exact scene overlayed with the user's own version of the subtitle.

Twit2gif was made by our team which included Ted Ying and Vera Lin, and won the Funniest Hack award at _[HackCooper 2015](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackcooper-2015){:target="_blank"}_!

There is also a [demo reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-kjs2a159Y){:target="_blank"} available on Youtube.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yingted/twit2gif/){:target="_blank"}.
