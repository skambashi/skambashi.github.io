A routing app for finding the safest route from one place to another! A user can apply weighted metrics to routes, and configure their own way home based on their preferences.

We used OpenStreetMap data, alongside various datasets such as historical crime data to compute the optimal route. CartoDB and Leaflet were used for the visualization.

Streetsavvy was a product made by our awesome team composed of Charlie Brummitt, Gabriela Rojas, Marie Rose Muir, Patrick Boueri and Shayan Masood. We also won a prize for best visualization at [Data Hackathon](http://datahackathon2015.splashthat.com/){:target="_blank"}!.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/safewalknyc){:target="_blank"}.
